staging area and commit history
git status
git init ->it will be in master branch but we want to use main so
git init -b main
ls -la ->check which file is there or not
rm -rf .git ->it will delete your git file

if i want to track the file by git then we have to add that file into staging area
git add file_name or git add .(to add all file)

if you want to know all commit 
git log

whatever we do, that will be in working directory so we have to send in staging area

everytime you change ,add into staging area then do commit
for without staging to commit the use this command
using this git commit -a -m "added line 21 and 22" (-a means it will skip the staging area)

using this git diff -> it will tell you what is changed in file
